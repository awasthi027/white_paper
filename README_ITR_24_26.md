** Add Foreign Dividend **

Exmaple Total Divdent reciept $308

How to calculate tax on USA dividend received in India after paying 25% tax in USA? That calculation I need for form-67. Take example I got $308 dividend for USA Stock  $308 is total dividend including USA 25% Tax?

To calculate the tax on USA dividends received in India after paying 25% tax in the USA, you need to follow these steps for Form-67 (Foreign Income Tax Credit).
Example Given:

    Gross Dividend (before US tax): $308

    US Tax Rate on Dividend: 25%

    Amount Received in India (after US tax): $308 × (1 - 0.25) = $231

Step-by-Step Calculation for Form-67:

    Convert Foreign Dividend to INR:
    Use the RBI reference rate on the date of dividend receipt.

        Suppose 1 USD = ₹83 (for illustration).

        Gross Dividend in INR: $308 × 83 = ₹25,564

        Dividend Received in INR (after US tax): $231 × 83 = ₹19,173

    US Tax Paid (in INR):

        US Tax = Gross Dividend – Amount Received = $77

        US Tax in INR: $77 × 83 = ₹6,391

    Indian Tax Calculation:

        The gross dividend (₹25,564) is taxable in India.

        Add it to your total income and apply your applicable tax slab (e.g., 30% + 4% cess).

        Tax Liability (assuming 30% + 4% cess):

            31.2% of ₹25,564 = ₹7,976

    Foreign Tax Credit (FTC) under Section 91:

        Lower of:

            Actual US Tax Paid: ₹6,391

            Indian Tax on Foreign Income: ₹7,976

        FTC Allowed: ₹6,391

    Net Tax Payable in India:

        Indian Tax Liability: ₹7,976

        Less FTC: ₹6,391

        Net Tax Payable: ₹7,976 – ₹6,391 = ₹1,585

Reporting in Form-67:
Description    Amount (₹)
Gross Foreign Dividend (before US tax)    25,564
Foreign Tax Paid (US Tax)    6,391
Indian Tax on Foreign Income    7,976
Foreign Tax Credit Claimed (Lower of US tax or Indian tax)    6,391
Net Tax Payable in India    1,585
